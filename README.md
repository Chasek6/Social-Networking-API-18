## SocialNetwork API


## Purpose
To create a social network api using Mongoose and Express.


## Description
This is an API for a social network. Express.js is used for routing, MongoDB is used for the database, and Mongoose is used for object modelling. With this API, users are able to share their thoughts, react to their friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friends list.

When API GET routes are requested in Insomnia, the data for users and thoughts are displayed.

New users and new thoughts are created through the API POST routes.

Users and thoughts can be updated via API PUT routes and can be deleted via API DELETE routes.

Reactions to thoughts can be created and users' friends can be added via API POST routes and thoughts and friends can be deleted via API DELETE routes.
